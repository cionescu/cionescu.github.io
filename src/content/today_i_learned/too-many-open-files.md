## Failed to open TCP connection to [..] (Too many open files)

```bash
Errno::EMFILE:
       Failed to open TCP connection to 127.0.0.1:9515 (Too many open files - socket(2) for "127.0.0.1" port 9515)
```

After running `ulimit -Sn 10240` in bash, the underlying error becomes visible. For me, this was:

```bash
 Failure/Error: expect(page).to have_content 'Some text'
       expected to find text "Some text" in "Some other text"
```
